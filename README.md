# Pharma-Supply-Chain-System-using-Smart-Contracts/QUESTION 2
Explanation
Main Menu:

The script presents a menu to the user with options to register a product, transfer a product, verify a product, get product details, or get the transfer history.
User Input:

The script accepts input from the user for each operation. For example, when registering a product, it asks for the product ID, name, and manufacturer.
Looping:

The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit by selecting option 6.
How It Works
Register a Product: The user inputs the product ID, name, and manufacturer, which gets stored in the system.
Transfer a Product: The user inputs the product ID, new owner, and status. The system updates the product's current owner and adds this transfer to the history.
Verify a Product: The user can verify the authenticity of a product by inputting its ID.
Get Product Details: The user inputs the product ID to retrieve its current details.
Get Transfer History: The user inputs the product ID to view its entire transfer history.
This script provides a basic simulation of a pharma supply chain system with user interaction, allowing you to see how such a system could work.
